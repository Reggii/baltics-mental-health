In this short analysis will be looking at data pertaining to the following mental health trends in the Baltic region:
- Anxiety

- Alcohol use disorders

Percentages are calculated based on the total population for that year.

### Datasets 
All datasets provided by https://ourworldindata.org

Data was queried and re-organized using MySQL.

Visualizations were created with said data using Power BI.

## Latvia

Latvia has seen a significant decrease in deaths related to self-harm over the past 23 years, going from 4.95% in 1994 to 2.38% in 2017. In contrast, the rate of drug use disorders has increased from 3.26% in 1990 to 3.87% in 2017, while the rate of alcohol use disorders has slightly decreased to 3.46% in 2017 compared to its peak of 3.72% in 1995. 

Meanwhile, the rate of anxiety-related disorders has remained steady at around 3.56% from 1990 to 2017, and the rate of depression has decreased from 3.93% in 1990 to 3.36% in 2017.

## Estonia

Quite like Latvia, Estonia has had a major decrease in self-harm related deaths since their peak of 5.03% in 1995 to their lowest rate of 2.22% in 2017. And while drug related disorders have climbed from 3.01% to 3.93%, alcohol related disorders have slightly dipped to around the 3.30% mark from their high of 3.60% in 2000. Depression has also decreased from 3.80% in 1990 to 3.22% in 2017, while anxiety disorders have remained stagnant at around 3.57%.

Lithuania tells a similair to story to its Baltic neighbours with the decrease of self-harm, albeit from a lower peak of 4.41% in 2000 to the lowest rate of 2.44% in 2017. Alcohol use disorders have however seen a bigger decrease from 3.86% in 1990 to 3.36% in 2017 and a sharp increase in druge use disorders can be observed from 3.42% in 2000 to 3.94% in 2017.

Depression is at a similair level to 1990 in 3.55% at 3.46% in 2017, while anxiety disorders have remained static at around 3.60%.

## Conclusions

Based on the given data we can observe visible declines in mental health disorders since the 90's which is not surprising, considering that the Baltics have gone through increadible leaps of progress since the collapse of the Soviet Union, improving their standards of living, health institutions, etc.

The only worrying trend we see is the increase in drug use disorders, which is generally met with a decline in alcohol use disorders that likely speaks to the change in availability of substances and the difference in cultural norms compared to the 90's. Hopefully the Baltic region will keep developing it's appraoch towards drug use rehabilitation through investment and changes in legislature.

The data is definitely not conclusive and gives only a general overview based on the total population without exploring more nuanced demographics. And since I did not explore further in this analysis on how the data was collected, what was the sample size and so on, please take the conclusions with a grain of salt.
